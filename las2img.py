# las2img.py
#
# Usage:
#   las2img file_path resolution
#
#   `file_path` is a path to the LAS file.
#   `resolution` is in meters per pixel.
#
# Description:
#   Transforms a LAS file into an aerial-view discretized grayscale image.
#   The lowest points are white, the highest points are black.
#   Points for which there is no collected data are colored white.
